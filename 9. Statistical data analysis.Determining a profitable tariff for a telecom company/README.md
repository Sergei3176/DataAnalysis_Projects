# PROJECT: Determining a profitable tariff for a telecom company.

## DATA:
five tables, containing information about customers, and the nature of the use of services provided under each tariff, as well as characteristics of tariffs themselves.

THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT: to determine the most favourable tariff for the company.

**During the study, the following work was done:**

For each user counted:
- the number of calls made and spent minutes of conversation by month;
- the number of sent messages by month;
- the amount of Internet traffic used by month;
- monthly revenue from each user.
The behaviour of the operator's clients is described based on the sample: it was found out how many minutes of conversation, how many messages and how much Internet traffic is required by users of each tariff per month. Calculated: average quantity, variance and standard deviation for quantitative indicators of tariff usage. The distributions are described.
Statistical hypotheses tested:
- the average revenue of users of the "Ultra" and "Smart" tariffs do not differ;
- the average revenue of users from Moscow does not differ from the revenue of users from other regions.

## Main acquired skills:
Preprocessing and exploratory analysis and data visualization. Formulation and testing of statistical hypotheses.

## Libraries used:
Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, math, Datetime, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Status: Completed
