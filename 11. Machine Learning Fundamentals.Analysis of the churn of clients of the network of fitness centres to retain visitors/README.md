# PROJECT: Analysis of the churn of clients of the network of fitness centres to retain visitors.

## DATA:
csv-table containing customer data for the previous month before checking the fact of the outflow and information based on the log of visits, purchases and information about the current status of the customer's subscription.

THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT:
analyze customer churn and prepare an action plan to retain them.

**During the study, the following work was done:**
- forecasting the probability of churn (at the level of the next month) for each client;
  - formation of typical client portraits: identification of several of the most striking groups and a description of their main properties;
- analysis of the main features that most strongly affect the churn;
- a model for predicting customer churn was created;
- client clustering was carried out;
- conclusions were drawn and recommendations were developed to improve the quality of work with clients (target groups of clients were identified, measures were proposed to reduce churn, and other features of interaction with clients were identified).

## Main acquired skills:
Preprocessing and exploratory analysis and data visualization. Testing statistical hypotheses. Creation of a customer churn forecasting model. Client clustering.

## Libraries used:
Pandas, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
