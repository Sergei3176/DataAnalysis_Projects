# Data-Analytics-Projects:

This repository contains projects completed as part of the online course "Data Analyst" of Yandex.Practicum service.

During the implementation of the projects, the skills of writing code in the Python programming language were developed, using the libraries Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn. I gained experience connecting to databases, writing SQL queries and loading data using the SQLAlchemy library. During the implementation of the projects, data visualization skills were obtained using Tableau Public and the Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn libraries. Experience in data preprocessing and EDA, cohort analysis, unit economics analysis, and testing of statistical hypotheses has been formed. I got basic knowledge and skills in machine learning, data classification and clustering, A/B testing.
