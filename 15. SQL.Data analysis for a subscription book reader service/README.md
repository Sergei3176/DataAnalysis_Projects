# PROJECT: Data analysis for a subscription book reader service.

## DATA:
Database (five tables) containing information about books, publishers, and authors, as well as user reviews of books and reader ratings.

## THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT: analysis of information to create a value proposition for a new product.

**During the study, the following work was done:**

- Finding out the number of published books since 2000;
- Finding out the popularity of published books among readers (number of reviews and average rating);
- Identification of the most active publishing house engaged in the publication of voluminous books (in our case - 50 pages or more);
- Determination of the most popular author at the moment (the highest average rating of the author's books among the most active readers, those who left more than 50 ratings);
- Determination of the average number of reviews from the most active readers, as they influence the choice of other readers.

## Main acquired skills:
Database connection. Writing queries in PostgreSQL.
